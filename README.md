In this code, we define a functional component called App which renders a simple login form. We use the useState hook to define two state variables, email and password, which are initially set to empty strings.

The handleSubmit function is called when the user submits the login form. It prevents the default form submission behavior, logs the email and password values to the console, and can be updated to perform authentication or other tasks as needed.

The form element contains two label elements and two input elements for the email and password fields. The value and onChange props are used to bind the input fields to their corresponding state variables, and the required prop ensures that the user must enter a value before submitting the form.

Finally, the button element is used to submit the form. This example code uses an external CSS file (App.css) to style the login page, but you can customize the styling as needed.
